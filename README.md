# VolibearBot

This project is an on-going WIP!

Goals:

- Create a Bot for the Discord Server of the E-Sport Division of the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, to help users with research activities regarding gaming.
- Obivously Open Source, duh
- Possibly enabling other German Universities to use the Bot for their own servers
- RaspberryPi 4 will be used as a server for the Bot to run for now, Code in Python3


(Probably) Used Libraries and APIs:

- Discord.py https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html
- Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/
- League of Legends API provided by Riot Games (Probably gonna do a python wrapper for that, or find a good existing one)
